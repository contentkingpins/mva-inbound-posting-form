## 🔄 **The Course Correction**

### **What We Changed:**
- ❌ Removed complex AI auto-assignment router  
- ❌ Removed demo pages
- ✅ Built simple lead claiming system (matches actual workflow)
- ✅ Kept sophisticated analytics running in background
- ✅ Created practical agent dashboard

### **Why:**
User clarified their actual workflow:
1. **Lead routing happens outside CRM** (inbound calls)
2. **Agents search available leads** 
3. **Agent claims lead** (one-click)
4. **Lead locks to that agent**
5. **Admin can reassign if needed**
